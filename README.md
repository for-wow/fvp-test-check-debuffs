### Description:
The addon is a small frame that displays the maximum count of debuffs registered on the target. You can change the position of this frame on the screen using drag and drop. This maximum count of debuffs is automatically updated once per second. When you enter the game this count = 0.

Once per second, the addon reads the debuffs on your target, counts their number and displays the maximum count.

This count will remain on the screen even when you don't have a target. But this counter is not saved when you relogin or exit the game.
