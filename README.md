### Description:
1. The addon adds frames for debuffs from 17 to 40 (they are arranged in a row, there is no beautiful arrangement). It is required to visually check whether the game places the debuffs themselves in these frames.
2. Selecting a target opens a frame that lists the target's debuffs from 15 to 18. These debuffs are requested by the API function. This data is automatically updated once per second. It is required to visually check whether the values for 17 and 18 debuffs are filled or only for 15 and 16.
